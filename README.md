1. need to set up HTML & css.
2. Find img for a box that can be filled halfway and then fully with color.
3. Set up display box for these squares, they should add up to one hour of productivity.
4. Set up timer with start button.
5. Set up javascript to fill boxes with color when time hits specific point.



Notes: This also provides me with proper positioning with HTML and CSS.
